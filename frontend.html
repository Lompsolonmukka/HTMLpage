		<h2>ICT Frontend Development</h2>
		<div class="paragraph">
			<p>Front-end development focuses on the visual side of digital systems. As in, the user interface of a program, or what people see when they open a webpage. Coding languages used for the front-end development usually consist, but are not limited to, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
			In todays digital world, front end coding has changed and become more important after introducing variable platforms used to access programs and websites. Those old time static hardcoded pages won’t work anymore, since we need scalability for them to be usable with small handheld computers like smartphones and tablets, as well as with pcs and smart-TVs, only naming few. Also, increasing amounts of data being displayed on pages, dynamic applications and such need more and more attention from the programmers, since coding errors and bugs have tendency to multiply and cause misbehavior in program interfaces.</p>

			<p>One of the fast-developing technologies are the IoT-systems. IoT, or Internet of Things, is spreading into industries and consumers alike, automating processes and giving information that has been out of reach until now. For that use, front end development has started creating user-friendly interfaces, that convert waste amounts of data into simple and readable form and let users interact with the devices by setting properties and regulating behavior. This has led to some challenges with coding, since JavaScript isn’t suited for massive data handling. This has been confronted with new libraries, framework and programming languages, such as Elm, that is used to write code which is then transformed into JavaScript. This will simplify the front-end programming process, when instead of telling the program step by step how to do things, you’ll only need to tell what it is supposed to do. These paradigm make use of predetermined subroutines that can be reused. JavaScript is widely used program language that works almost everywhere and has stabilized itself as the assembly language of the web.
			Concerning front-end in IoT systems, there is a rising trend to make simpler languages for appliance user interfaces. This side of the machine communication has been disregarded until now. The development for IoT specific programming language is on its way and the goal is to make routines that are ready to use and compatible with each other to be used in variable fields of IoT network of programs. For example, home security or ventilation system controlled from phone application.</p>

			<p>Lastly, I’d like to mention one specific graphic design program for front end development called Hayaku. Since graphically rich interfaces are still difficult to make, some design tools have been introduced into the field. Typically writing the code with a program rather than by hand leads to massive data files that cannot be modified later due to fragmentation, or while suitable for one platform, may not work on others. Hayaku has tackled this problem by making use of both program-based visualization and manual coding. While making the items for interface, for example buttons, you will still be required to manipulate the low-level code to implement animations and interactions, like clicking the button. This will keep the program code light and easier to apply fixes later.</p>
