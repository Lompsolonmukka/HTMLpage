			<h2>About JavaScript</h2>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>JS, or JavaScript is a programming language that is lightweight and most well-known scripting language for the web. JavaScript is a prototype-based(inherited behavior usage), multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language that supports object-oriented, imperative and declarative programming styles. It's basic syntax is similar to Java and C++. It enables interactive webpages by embedding into the HTML and CSS.</p>
				<p>First JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. </p>

			<div class="paragraph">
				<p>JavaScript is basically a programming language that controls the behavior of different elements on a webpage. Accessibility is a challenge of it's own in software development. JavaScript is a good asset when used wisely, and can make your website more accessible, but can also make a mess and break the page if used carelessly. To use JavaScript as an aid in your projects, there is some things that are good to know about:</p>
				<p>&rArr;Make it so that your page works well in text-only form, rely mostly on HTML. For example, use unordered lists in your drop-down menus.</p>
				<p>&rArr;Everything should be possible to do with keyboard. So that you could tab through controls and links in logical order. And if you use pointer events like klicks and hovering, duplicate those events to keyboard.</p>
				<p>&rArr;Do not set time limits, since it takes more time to navigate with keyboard, and loading times are individual on each browser and user.</p>
				<p>&rArr;Do not make flashy or long animations, because flashing can cause seizures. Also for longer than couple seconds animations offer a way to cancel them</p>
				<p>&rArr;Do not update, redirect or refresh automatically, nor use popups and such without warning. Let users decide their actions.</p>
				<p>&rArr;Always have a packup plan, in case your script doesn't work or if there are users that have JS disabled.</p>
